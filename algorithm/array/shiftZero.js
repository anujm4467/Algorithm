/**
 * Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s of a given array to the end of the array.
 * For example, if the given arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0},
 * it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}.
 * The order of all other elements should be same.
 * Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1)
